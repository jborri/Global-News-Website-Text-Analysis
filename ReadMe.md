Based off of the Bar Chart, Global News articles seems to be dominated by the terms, "Rights and War". This makes sense given the current global conflicts that are happening in the world at this moment. Health and access are almost equal in frequency. I believe this is because these terms are always important and constantly discussed in a global context. For liberation, it appeared with the lowest frequency. This might be due to the selection of news sources that have been chosen, but also the term is only discussed for select populations that are oppressed. Given that war is currently dominating news, it might be another reason why the frequency is so small.
